# Blurbette Plugin
A WordPress plugin for creating and managing re-usable snippets in a WordPress site.

Though fully functional, this project was mainly intended to serve as a step-by-step tutorial for creating WordPress plugins using object-oriented PHP. See the full tutorial at [WordPress Craftsman](http://www.wpcraftsman.com/blurbette-plugin/).
